# Welcome
Diia is an app that provides access to digital documents and services. Forget about piles of paper and long queues. Use government services without leaving your home.

Moreover, companies and institutions can become partners with Diia. Integration can be done in several ways:

1. Sharing – allows to quickly obtain copies of digital documents from clients. It also enables the setup for receiving metadata to automatically fill in fields in the partner's information system.
2. Diia.Signature – a qualified electronic signature that can be used to sign documents and authorize in the app or on the partner's website.
3. Validation – verification of the validity of a digital document or user data.

# Get started
We want our partners to be able to set up integration and start working with real clients as quickly and effortlessly as possible. That’s why our team is making the open-source code, which allows viewing, modifying, or even suggesting your own version in one of the programming languages that we don’t yet support.

Now, a partner only needs to copy a part of the code instead of spending time writing it. Choose your programming language and get started!
